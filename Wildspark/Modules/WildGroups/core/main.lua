-- (SharedUIPanelTemplates.lua:929-945). So no button here is given an
-- OnMouseDown or OnMouseUp of its own -- setting either would silently take

-- ONE HANDLER FOR EVERY BUTTON AND LINK, because what differs between them is
-- the action, not the click. `action` is nil whenever the control is hidden, so
-- a click that somehow arrives on a stale frame does nothing rather than
-- repeating the last row's action.
--
-- THE LOCK IS CHECKED HERE AS WELL AS ENFORCED BY Disable(), a belt-and-braces
-- the stakes justify: Disable() is IsProtectedFunction
-- (SimpleButtonAPIDocumentation.lua:54-66), and if it were ever refused the
-- failure mode without this line is pestering a stranger repeatedly. With it,
-- the failure mode is a click that does nothing. A spec re-enables a locked
-- control behind the addon's back to prove this branch is live.
--
-- AN ACTION THAT RETURNS false STARTS NO COOLDOWN. The cooldown paces what
-- reaches other players; an action that ends up sending nothing -- Ask to Join
-- opening a whisper box for the player to type in -- says so, and leaves every
-- button live. Any other return, including none, locks as before.

--- The addon's one tooltip for a control that explains itself: `title` in

--- Blizzard's usual informational tooltip (GameTooltip_SetTitle,
--- GameTooltip_AddNormalLine, Blizzard_SharedXML/SharedTooltipTemplates.lua:
--- 128, :142); gold, not red, which Blizzard keeps for errors and lockouts.
--- GameTooltip_SetTitle clears the lines first, so each call starts afresh.

--- The addon's one plain tooltip: `text` alone, in white, anchored to the
--- control's right. Word-wrapped only when `wrap` is true.
---
--- SetText takes SIX arguments, (text, r, g, b, alpha, wrap), and the colour is
--- not optional (FrameAPITooltipDocumentation.lua, SetText: colorR/G/B
--- Nilable = false). Alpha comes BEFORE wrap, so a five-argument call puts
--- `wrap` into alpha. SetText accepts a secret text (ConditionalSecret), but
--- not nil.

--- A small icon that explains itself on hover: a Frame `size` square on
--- `parent`, one texture covering it (`icon.Icon`, for the caller to dress),
--- `showTooltip` as its OnEnter and GameTooltip_Hide as its OnLeave. Starts
--- hidden.
---
--- A FRAME, not a bare texture, so it can take the mouse for its tooltip. But
--- only the MOTION half: clicks are left off, so a click on the icon lands on
--- whatever is beneath it. Blizzard's own shape for a region that only
--- explains itself (CooldownViewer.lua:326-328; the player frame's health bar,
--- Mainline/PlayerFrame.xml:196). Both setters are in the running client's
--- widget dump (WidgetAPI.lua:123-124).
---
--- The cost, known and accepted: moving onto the icon is leaving whatever is
--- beneath it, so that frame's own hover (tooltip, highlight) gives way to the
--- icon's while the mouse is over it.
---
--- Shared by the guild/friend icon (core/relations.lua) and a collapsed filter
--- section's warning (core/filterpanel_shared.lua).

--- The same kind of action as CreateRowActionButton, drawn as a text link
--- (CreateRowLink above).
---
--- SAME LIST, SAME HANDLER, SAME LOCK. Being in rowButtons is what makes the

--- visible -- which is why ApplyActionLockTo needs nothing extra for a link.

---------- The load greeting
-------------------------------------------------------

-- ONE LINE, NAMING THE BUILD AND THE WAY IN.
--
-- Not decoration. This addon is hand-copied to a test machine, and without it
-- "did the version I just copied actually load" is a question only a file
-- listing can answer -- which is exactly how two silent non-updates were
-- diagnosed during development.
--
-- An earlier greeting said "Hello from LFG Forever!" and was removed for being
-- noise once the addon had a window of its own. The difference is that this
-- one carries what a tester and a bug report both need: which build, and how
-- to open it.
--
-- THE VERSION COMES FROM THE TOC, via C_AddOns.GetAddOnMetadata
-- (GlobalAPI.lua:205). A version typed in here would be a second place to bump
-- on every release, and the one that gets forgotten. Nilable -- a TOC without
-- a Version line is legal -- and losing the version is not a reason to lose
-- the line saying the addon loaded, so the format drops that segment instead.
--
-- EventUtil.ContinueOnAddOnLoaded(addOnName, callback)
--   Blizzard_SharedXML/EventUtil.lua:67-75, loaded unconditionally by
--   Blizzard_SharedXML.toc:37 (verified with `element_check.py global
--   EventUtil`).
--
-- Preferred over a hand-rolled ADDON_LOADED frame for two reasons:
--   * it unregisters itself after the first matching event, so the callback
--     cannot run twice;
--   * it fires straight away if the addon is somehow already loaded, so there
--     is no path where the message is silently lost.
--
-- Called with our own name from our own file, C_AddOns.IsAddOnLoaded returns
-- isLoaded = false (we are still *loading*), so this takes the register branch
-- and fires on our own ADDON_LOADED.
EventUtil.ContinueOnAddOnLoaded(addonName, function()
	local version = LFGF.MODULE_VERSION or C_AddOns.GetAddOnMetadata(addonName, "Version")

	-- print() is the FrameXML global from Blizzard_PrintHandler.lua:93; it
	-- routes through securecall to the default chat frame.
	if version then
		print(L.LOADED_VERSION_FORMAT:format(LFGF.TITLE, version, LFGF.SLASH_COMMAND))
	else
		print(L.LOADED_FORMAT:format(LFGF.TITLE, LFGF.SLASH_COMMAND))
	end
end)
