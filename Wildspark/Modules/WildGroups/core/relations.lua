-- LFGForever -- core/relations.lua
--
-- Who the player KNOWS: a guildmate, or a friend (WoW or Battle.net). The
-- players list and the whisper log put a small icon before such a name --
-- friends-icon-tab-guildmates for a guildmate, friends-icon-tab-friends for a
-- friend -- and the players list also moves them up its boxes.
--
-- TWO ROUTES, because the two lists hold different things:
--   * a whisper carries the sender's GUID (the 12th CHAT_MSG_WHISPER field,
--     ChatInfoDocumentation.lua:2611), so RelationByGUID asks the GUID APIs --
--     the same ones Blizzard's own social code asks (SocialQueue.lua:199-204);
--   * a search result carries only NAMES -- LfgSearchResultPlayerInfo has no
--     GUID (LFGListInfoDocumentation.lua:1013-1027) -- so a lookup asks by
--     name.
--
-- GUILD WINS when someone is both: it is the narrower, more specific fact.
--
-- TWO OPTIONS, one per relation (core/settings.lua, read through
-- LFGF.MarkGuildmates / LFGF.MarkFriends in core/main.lua). OFF MEANS NO CALL:
-- with "Mark guild members" off nothing here touches IsInGuild, IsGuildMember or
-- C_GuildInfo; with "Mark friends" off nothing touches C_FriendList,
-- C_BattleNet or BNGetNumFriends. Every guild and friend call in the addon is
-- in this file, so gating them here is the whole of that promise. Friends are
-- off by default -- untested, because the beta has the friend system disabled.
--
-- NO EVENTS, BY DECISION. Nothing here listens for GUILD_ROSTER_UPDATE,
-- FRIENDLIST_UPDATE or a Battle.net change. The players list builds one lookup
-- per search and throws it away, so it is current on the next search; a whisper
-- row asks when it is drawn, so it is current when it is next drawn. What goes
-- stale in between is accepted -- see .claude/rules/relation-icons.md.
--
-- SECRET VALUES. Every lookup below is SecretArguments = "AllowedWhenUntainted"
-- -- Blizzard may pass a secret, an addon may not -- and names and GUIDs are
-- secret in chat-messaging lockdown (a dungeon, a raid, a restricted map). So
-- every argument is checked with canaccessvalue FIRST and, when it cannot be
-- read, the answer is "no relation". That FAILS CLOSED, unlike the filters,
-- which fail open: a filter that cannot check a listing lets it through, but an
-- icon CLAIMS something, and when it cannot be checked the honest answer is no
-- icon.

---------- Asking
-------------------------------------------------------

--- Is this character in the same game as the player?
---
--- Blizzard's own camelot friends list draws exactly this line before treating
--- a Battle.net game account as a character here (Camelot/FriendsFrame.lua
--- :2063). clientProgram rules out the app and other games; wowProjectID rules
--- out a character in another WoW flavour who happens to share a name.
local function IsCharacterInThisGame(gameAccountInfo)
	return gameAccountInfo ~= nil
		and gameAccountInfo.clientProgram == BNET_CLIENT_WOW
		and gameAccountInfo.wowProjectID == WOW_PROJECT_ID
end

--- The relation to the character with this GUID, or nil.
---
--- The whisper log's route. Three GUID calls, no loop:
---   IsGuildMember(guid)                    in the client dump, undocumented;
---                                          Blizzard's call, SocialQueue.lua:204
---   C_FriendList.IsFriend(guid)            FriendListDocumentation.lua:228
---   C_BattleNet.GetGameAccountInfoByGUID   BattleNetDocumentation.lua:208
---
--- IsFriend only when the WoW friend system is on, as Blizzard asks it
--- (SocialQueue.lua:199; its camelot friends list guards every WoW friend call
--- the same way, Camelot/FriendsFrame.lua:449, :1235).
---
--- Each half only while its option is on, read on every call: a whisper row
--- asks when it is drawn, so a row drawn after the option changed follows it.

--- The names of the Battle.net friends' characters in this game, as a set.
---

--- but undocumented; its first return is the total, as Blizzard's camelot
--- friends list reads it (Camelot/FriendsFrame.lua:771).
