-- LFGForever -- core/filterpanel.lua
--
-- The right-hand column: filters that narrow the list of groups and players.
--
-- THE CONTRACT
-- ------------
-- This file is a FACTORY. It creates and fills its own inset and returns it
-- UNANCHORED; core/window.lua places it. That split keeps each concern where it
-- can be read in one piece:
--
--   * this file  -- what a filter panel IS and how wide it needs to be
--   * window.lua -- where the two columns sit relative to each other
--
-- If this file anchored itself, the two-column layout would be spread across
-- three files and nobody could see it whole.
--
-- THE DEFAULT FILTER ROW
-- ----------------------
-- Category dropdown, activity dropdown, then a Search button where Blizzard
-- has its refresh button -- copied from Blizzard's camelot Browse panel
-- (Blizzard_LFGVanilla_Browse.lua:1041-1259 and
-- Mainline/Blizzard_LFGVanilla_Browse.xml:414-479) so the two read as one UI.
--
-- SECRET VALUES: this file is on the safe side of that line. Only five
-- C_LFGList getters are SecretInChatMessagingLockdown -- GetActiveEntryInfo,
-- GetApplicantInfo, GetSearchResultInfo, GetSearchResultLeaderInfo,
-- GetSearchResultPlayerInfo. Category and activity info are NOT among them, so
-- their names can be read and formatted normally. The
-- SecretArguments = "AllowedWhenUntainted" on GetLfgCategoryInfo constrains
-- what may be passed IN, and this file passes plain numbers. The results list
-- is where the care is needed, not here. The one read of GetActiveEntryInfo
-- (LFGF.Activities) takes only its activityIDs, which the documentation marks
-- NeverSecret (LFGListInfoDocumentation.lua:938).

-- How much room the filters need is a question about filters, so it lives here
-- rather than with the window's layout constants. Settings uses 199 for its
-- category column (Blizzard_SettingsPanel.xml:59); checkboxes, dropdowns and
-- their labels need considerably more if they are not to wrap.
-- 600, and it is the GROUP SECTION that sets it. Three checkboxes carrying
-- "Tank role available" / "Healer role available" / "Damage role available" on
-- one row need about 564 of content, plus 12 padding either side. The window is
-- 1165, so the list column still gets roughly 546 -- comfortably more than the
-- 312-wide rows Blizzard's own template draws.
--
-- The number and ROLE_TO_ROLE_GAP move together: at the 22 gap this row wanted
-- 608 and would overflow here. The "fits inside the panel" examples are what
-- hold the pair honest.

-- THE TAB STRIP sits in the gap between the window's title bar and this inset,
-- which is empty: the inset starts 60 below the frame's top (core/window.lua

-- to spare. That is exactly where MacroFrame puts its own top tabs
-- (Blizzard_MacroUI.xml:185, TOPLEFT x=51 y=-28).
--
-- The x inset is FriendsFrame's, the closest camelot analogue -- its TabSystem
-- hangs at x=18 (Camelot/FriendsFrame.xml:419).

-- ROLE CHECK IS THE SECONDARY BUTTON of the row, so it is narrower than
-- Search. It is fitted to its label by Blizzard's own
-- UIButtonFitToTextBehaviorMixin:FitToText (SecureUIPanelTemplates.lua:88-92),
-- which UIPanelButtonTemplate carries: width = label width + padding. The
-- template's padding is 40 (SecureUIPanelTemplates.xml:42), about 106 in
-- English and hardly narrower than Search's 111; 16, by the author's choice,
-- gives about 82. That is less than the template's two 12-wide end caps
-- (:44-57), so the label runs a little onto them. A longer translation of
-- ROLE_POLL widens the button rather than overflowing it. (Blizzard's own is a
-- fixed 120, Listing.xml:414, on a panel with nothing else to rank against.)

-- available" and every class under the role above it, without any box
-- depending on how long its neighbour's label happens to be.
--
-- The cost is the other side of that coin: a label that outgrows its column
-- would OVERLAP the next one rather than pushing it along. So both widths are
-- MINIMUMS: MeasureLayout widens a grid's columns, all rows at once, only when
-- one of its labels would not fit -- which a translated label may not
-- (core/locale.lua). English fits, so in English they are exactly these. The
-- "stays inside its column" examples are what hold each of these honest.
--
--   player -- 4 columns; the widest item is a class at ~100 ("Warrior")

-- derivable and it looked wrong: it detached the pair from the grid they sit
-- in, which is a reminder that "derived from Blizzard's own constants" is an
-- argument about provenance, not about whether it looks right.
--
-- So this one is what it says: a small nudge, by eye. Nothing derives it and
-- nothing should -- two was too little, six is the answer, and the spec asserts
-- the exact value because there is no reasoning to re-derive it from. It lives

-- (0.10.0-dev.1), by the author's wording.
--
-- FIND, not Filter, and they diverge from their neighbour on that: the activity
-- dropdown reads "Filter by activity", but that string is Blizzard's

--
-- Published so the spec and any future section can name the same string rather
-- than repeating the text, which is what made rewording these a one-line

-- trade for copy.
--
-- NONE of them has a GlobalString, unlike their neighbour the activity

---------- Level ranges
-------------------------------------------------------

--- The activities a category offers: what the dropdowns list, and what a
--- search with nothing ticked asks for.
---
--- BLIZZARD'S RULE, UNDER OUR OWN SETTING. Blizzard's Group Finder drops every
--- activity whose suggested level range does not hold the player's level, unless
--- its CVar disableSuggestedLevelActivityFilter is on
--- (LFGUtil_GetFilteredActivities, Blizzard_LFGVanilla_ParentFrame.lua:259-280).
--- This is the same rule with LFGF.ShowAllLevelRanges() in the CVar's place:
--- the addon never reads or writes Blizzard's CVar (core/main.lua says why), so
--- ticking the option in one finder does not change the other.
---
--- The rule, as Blizzard's:
---   * out of range means minLevelSuggestion above the player's level, or
---     maxLevelSuggestion below it; a 0 means no limit on that side, and both
---     ends count as inside;
---   * an activity of the player's own listing is always kept, so they can
---     find their own group. activityIDs is NeverSecret
---     (LFGListInfoDocumentation.lua:938); GetActiveEntryInfo answers nothing
---     when there is no listing (MayReturnNothing, :141).
---
--- ONE DIFFERENCE: an activity with no info table is KEPT. GetActivityInfoTable
--- is MayReturnNothing (:186) and Blizzard indexes it unguarded; here it is let
--- through, the way the filters let a listing through when they cannot check it.
---
--- UnitLevel carries no secret predicate (UnitDocumentation.lua:2474-2487), and
--- everything else read here is a plain number. Only engine API, so unlike the
--- LFGUtil_* helpers this works before the LoadOnDemand Group Finder is in.

---

--- GameFontNormalSmall, white on hover, sized to its words.
---
--- OWNED BY THE SECTION, so it is shown and hidden with it: the tab system
--- already hides a tab's sections (TabSystemOwner.lua:46-51), so a link that
--- belongs to one needs no tab code at all. That is why there is one per
--- section rather than one control re-dressed on every tab switch.
---
--- TOPRIGHT TO TOPRIGHT, never RIGHT. RIGHT is centre-bearing, and a section
--- that holds rows has its vertical centre halfway down them. Dropped by half
--- the difference between the title's height and the link's, so the small text
--- is centred on the large title's line. GetStringHeight is readable here: the
--- title is our own constant string, never a secret.

--- The Level row: a "Level" label and Blizzard's min/max level control, as the
--- next grid row of `section` (the role section).
---
--- LevelRangeFrameTemplate, not two boxes of ours. It is Blizzard's own level
--- range control (InputBoxTemplates.xml:378-409) -- two numeric boxes of three
--- letters with a dash between them -- and its mixin already answers the range
--- (GetLevelRange), empties it (Reset), moves focus between the boxes on Tab
--- and lowers a min above the max (FixLevelRange, InputBoxTemplates.lua
--- :380-433). It lives in Blizzard_SharedXML, which loads on camelot, and
--- Blizzard's retail finder, Auction House and crafting orders all use it.
---
--- AN EMPTY BOX IS NO LIMIT, by the author's rule: GetNumber reads an empty box
--- as 0, which Blizzard's own FixLevelRange also treats as "no max" (:408-411).
---
--- ONLY SEARCH SEARCHES, by the author's rule. Typing changes nothing until
--- Search (the values ride on its snapshot like every checkbox), and Enter --
--- which the template leaves unhandled -- only lets go of the box.
---
--- The label is LFGF.LEVEL_ROW_LABEL ("Player level range"), in
--- GameFontNormalSmall: the font UICheckButtonTemplate gives
--- the role labels above it (CheckButtonTemplates.xml:54). LEFT to the row's
--- TOPLEFT, dropped by half a row: the label sits on the row's vertical centre,

---
---   2. C_LFGList.Search is HasRestrictions = true

---      RESTRICTIONS, not combat alone. Checking only InCombatLockdown() would
---      let it through during an encounter and fail there instead.
---
---   3. Results are ASYNCHRONOUS. The button disables until
---      LFG_LIST_SEARCH_RESULTS_RECEIVED or LFG_LIST_SEARCH_FAILED arrives
---      (Browse.lua:317), or a player can stack requests -- or until

---------- The tabs
-------------------------------------------------------
-- TWO TABS over one column: FILTERS, holding all three filter sections, and
-- WHISPERS, holding the log core/whisperlog.lua builds.
--
-- BLIZZARD'S TabSystem, not a pair of buttons of ours. Shared\TabSystem\ is
-- gated only [ExcludeLoadGameType vanilla tbc] (Blizzard_SharedXML.toc:131-134),
-- so all four files load here -- and Blizzard's own CAMELOT FriendsFrame is
-- built on them (Camelot/FriendsFrame.xml:411-418, FriendsFrame.lua:521-522),
-- which is better evidence than "the template exists".
--
-- IT IS FOUR PIECES AND THE SPLIT IS THE POINT:
--   TabSystemMixin        owns the BUTTONS  -- a pool, AddTab, selection art
--   TabSystemOwnerMixin   glues the two     -- AddNamedTab, SetTab
--   TabSystemTrackerMixin owns the CONTENT  -- tabID -> a set of frames
--
-- The tracker is what earns the dependency. On every SetTab it walks EVERY
-- registered element of EVERY tab and shows only the chosen tab's
-- (TabSystemOwner.lua:46-51). So "the class section belongs to Filters" is a
-- REGISTRATION, not a branch in a function someone has to remember to extend
-- when a fourth section arrives.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT ON A TAB: the category dropdown, the activity dropdown and the
-- Search button. They govern the LIST, which is on screen under both tabs, so
-- they sit above the strip and belong to neither. Registering them with a tab
-- is the mistake to avoid -- the tracker hides everything it knows about that
-- is not on the current tab, so one accidental registration takes the Search
-- button away whenever the player reads their whispers.

--- Put every checkbox on the Filters tab back the way the panel opened, and
--- empty the two level boxes (no limit either way, as the panel opens).
---
--- Run by the "Reset filters" link.
---
--- THE CHECKBOXES ONLY, by the author's decision. The link lives in the
--- "Find groups by role" header, among the filters it clears; the category and
--- activity dropdowns sit in the search row above, on neither tab, and keep
--- whatever the player chose. (When it was a button in their row it reset
--- those two as well.)
---
--- IT DOES NOT SEARCH. Resetting is not asking -- the same line the
--- auto-selected category draws.
---
--- IT SAVES, by the author's decision: the defaults become the saved Filters
--- tab, so the next session opens reset too. The list keeps the filters it
--- was searched with until the next Search; nothing is sent to it here.

--   Find groups by role    [My filters v] | Save new filter | Reset filters
--
-- The author's decisions, one at a time (.claude/rules/my-filters.md):
--   * a filter is the Filters tab only -- boxes and level range, never the
--     category or activities -- the same record Search and Reset save;
--   * picking a name fills the boxes and SAVES them as the current filters,
--     like Reset; it does not search, and the list waits for Search;
--   * the x on a row deletes at once, with no question, and the menu stays
--     open;

---------- The Role Check button
-------------------------------------------------------
-- BLIZZARD'S OWN, from the Listing tab of their camelot Group Finder
-- (Mainline/Blizzard_LFGVanilla_Listing.xml:413-433,
-- Blizzard_LFGVanilla_Listing.lua:612-637): a UIPanelButtonTemplate reading
-- ROLE_POLL, enabled for a group's leader or assistant, calling
-- InitiateRolePoll(). The API carries no HasRestrictions and no secret
-- annotation (UnitRoleDocumentation.lua:29-36); every member then gets
-- Blizzard's RolePollPopup (Blizzard_FrameXML/Mainline/RolePoll.lua), which
-- loads here and is in the running-client frame dump.
--
-- IT SITS IN THE SEARCH ROW, ON NEITHER TAB: it is about the group, not about
-- the filters or the whispers, so the player should not have to pick a tab to
-- find it.
--
-- ITS OWN LOCK, NOT THE ROW ACTIONS'. After a click it is disabled for
-- LFGF.ACTION_COOLDOWN_SECONDS, the addon's one delay (core/main.lua). Joining
-- the shared lock would have been less code and wrong: unlocking that one
-- enables every control it holds, and this button must stay off afterwards
-- for anyone who is no longer the leader. So its state is one rule, "may lead
-- a role check and not cooling down", re-applied from every input.

--- May the player start a role check? Blizzard's rule, Listing.lua:631-637.
---
--- UnitIsGroupLeader and UnitIsGroupAssistant are
--- SecretWhenUnitIdentityRestricted (UnitDocumentation.lua:2023, :2039) -- not
--- a combat predicate, so the out-of-combat assumption does not cover it. A
--- secret boolean cannot be tested from addon code, so each answer is checked
--- first, and an unreadable one FAILS OPEN: a non-leader's click only earns the
--- server's own refusal, while a leader shut out of the button has no way
--- round it. IsInGroup carries no documentation at all (it is in the client
--- dump, GlobalAPI.lua) and is guarded the same way.
