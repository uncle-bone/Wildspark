--
-- The left-hand column: the list of groups and players.
--
-- Same factory contract as core/filterpanel.lua -- create, fill, return
-- unanchored, and let core/window.lua place it.
--
-- SHAPE, copied from Blizzard's camelot Browse panel (Blizzard_LFGVanilla_
-- Browse.lua:52-137, :184-231, :364-498):
--   * a TREE view, not a linear one, because results are grouped into
--     collapsible "Players" and "Groups" subtrees;
--   * Blizzard's own row templates, so rows look identical;
--   * one row per result, plus one divider per category.
--
-- IT LISTENS, IT IS NOT TOLD. core/filterpanel.lua runs the search; this panel
-- registers for the same game events. Neither panel knows the other exists.
--
-- SECRET VALUES -- the reason this file is more careful than the filter panel.
-- GetSearchResultInfo, GetSearchResultLeaderInfo and GetSearchResultPlayerInfo
-- are all SecretInChatMessagingLockdown = true (LFGListInfoDocumentation.lua
-- :397, :414, :431). That is a per-FUNCTION flag: it makes the WHOLE return
-- secret while the predicate holds, and the opt-out is a per-field
-- NeverSecret = true. LfgSearchResultData has exactly one (partyGUID, :1009);
-- LfgSearchResultPlayerInfo has NONE. So in lockdown even numMembers and
-- isDelisted are secret, not just the obvious name and comment.
--
-- Three operations error on a secret, and this file does all three carefully:
--   comparing  (numMembers <= 1)          -> guard, then compare
--   concatenating (LEVEL_ABBR .. level)   -> pass the value to a setter instead
--   indexing a table BY the value
--       (RAID_CLASS_COLORS[classFilename]) -> guard, else fall back
--
-- The guard is canaccessvalue, which is the question Blizzard's own chat filter
-- registry asks (ChatFrameFilters.lua:115-118) and is stricter than
-- issecretvalue: false for a secret AND for a value the caller may not touch.
-- Where a guard fails this file FAILS OPEN -- it shows the listing rather than
-- hiding it, because hiding what you could not verify is the worse mistake.

---------- Reading a result safely
-------------------------------------------------------

---------- The row action buttons
-------------------------------------------------------

-- TWO ACTIONS, ONE SLOT. What a listing is decides which of them makes sense,
-- and they are never both right at once:
--
--   a PLAYER listing  ->  invite them into your party   (a plus)
--   a GROUP  listing  ->  ask to be let into theirs     (a speech bubble)
--
-- So the two buttons occupy the SAME rect at the right end of the row rather
-- than two side by side. That is not only tidier: the row's roles column is
-- anchored to the left of that rect, so one slot means the roles line up in a
-- single column across every row, instead of stepping in and out by a button's
-- width as the list mixes players and groups.
--
-- The speech bubble is natively 13x13 in the running client's atlas dump
-- (AtlasInfo.lua:25094), the same size as the plus the shared factory wears
-- (:3276), so the pair is drawn 1:1 and reads as one set. That it comes off the
-- transmog art sheet is irrelevant at this size -- what matters is that the
-- dump proves it exists here, which is the only evidence an atlas name can have.
local ASK_TO_JOIN_ICON_ATLAS = "transmog-icon-chat"

-- No Blizzard global says this, so the addon says it, in the same plain English
-- as its filter-section titles.
local ASK_TO_JOIN_LABEL = L.ASK_TO_JOIN

-- under Options -> AddOns -> LFG Forever (core/settings.lua). The text, with
-- its placeholders (%class%, %level%, %talents%, %role%) filled in, comes from
-- LFGF.AskToJoinMessage in core/main.lua at CLICK time.

-- THE BUTTON SHAPE AND THE ACTION COOLDOWN NOW LIVE IN core/main.lua, because
-- core/whisperlog.lua puts the same plus on an incoming whisper. Sharing the
-- SHAPE is tidiness; sharing the LOCK is correctness -- two copies would be two
-- independent cooldowns, and the property that makes it worth having is that

--- Decide whether this row may be invited, and wire the click if so.

--- WHO IS ELIGIBLE IS BLIZZARD'S CALL. LFGBrowseUtil_GetInviteActionForResult
--- (Browse.lua:1456-1472) hands back a function only for a SOLO listing and
--- only when the player can invite -- in a group they do not lead, nobody can.
--- Reusing it keeps this icon and their right-click menu item agreeing about
--- who is invitable, instead of two rules that drift.
---
--- OUR OWN GUARD ON TOP (CanActOnRow), and it is the one place this does
--- better than the menu it shortcuts: a leaderName that cannot be read here
--- would be refused, and an icon that errors when clicked is worse than no
--- icon, so it is hidden. Blizzard's menu item checks only that the name is
--- non-nil (:1016) and still offers it.
---
--- THEN THE WHISPER (.claude/rules/invite-whisper.md):
--- after Blizzard's invite, the click whispers the player
--- LFGF.InviteWhisperMessage() (core/main.lua) when that answers text --
--- "Hey! Want to join Deadmines?". Invite first, by the author's decision, so
--- the whisper arrives with the invite popup. Neither call says whether it
--- worked (InviteUnit returns nothing and may wait on a confirmation,
--- PartyInfoDocumentation.lua:361), so the whisper does not wait on the
--- invite. Read at CLICK time, as Ask to Join's is. Only this button: the
--- whisper log's Invite link and Blizzard's right-click Group Invite never send
--- it.
---
--- The target is the row's leaderName, readable by CanActOnRow, and checked
--- again inside the click by LFGF.Whisper, for the reason
--- UpdateAskToJoinButton gives. One click is one action under the shared
--- two-second lock (RunAction, core/main.lua).
---
--- Set on EVERY update, because rows are pooled: a row that was a solo listing
--- keeps its button otherwise.
local function UpdateInviteButton(row, info, isDelisted)

end

--- Decide whether this row may be asked to take the player, and wire the click.
---
--- THE MIRROR OF THE INVITE RULE: this one is for GROUPS. A solo listing has no
--- group to join, so asking would be nonsense; Blizzard's own eligibility helper
--- draws the same line from the other side (numMembers == 1, Browse.lua:1462).
---
--- WHEN numMembers IS SECRET, isSolo is false and this button is the one that
--- would show -- but leaderName is secret in exactly the same states, so the
--- guard below hides it anyway. One check covers both, because
--- SecretInChatMessagingLockdown makes the WHOLE return secret at once.
---
--- THAT GUARD IS ALSO THE LOCKDOWN GUARD. C_ChatInfo.SendChatMessage is
--- SecretArguments = "AllowedWhenUntainted" (ChatInfoDocumentation.lua:568), so
--- a secret target from an addon is refused -- and the state that makes
--- leaderName secret is the same state C_ChatInfo.InChatMessagingLockdown
--- reports, so there is nothing for a second call to add.
---
--- WHAT THE CLICK DOES follows the setting, read when the button is CLICKED so
--- a change in the settings takes effect on rows already drawn:
---   * LFGF.AskToJoinMessage() returns text -> whisper it to the leader;
---   * it returns nil (checkbox off, or an empty message) -> open a whisper to
---     the leader for the player to type in, ChatFrameUtil.SendTell
---     (ChatFrameUtil.lua:383-386), the call Blizzard's own "Send Message"
---     makes (Blizzard_LFGVanilla_Browse.lua:1014). It string.formats the name
---     (:374), which the readable-name guard already covers.
--- Only the auto-whisper starts the shared cooldown: opening a whisper box
--- sends nothing, so that path returns false and RunAction leaves the buttons
--- live.
---
--- RE-CHECKED INSIDE THE CLICK, and that guard is the one thing here the test
--- harness cannot falsify -- removing it fails no example. It is kept because
--- the sources define secrecy as "whether this particular value is classified
--- RIGHT NOW, decided by the active restriction state" rather than as a
--- property fixed when the value was handed over, and the row is not redrawn
--- when the player walks into a dungeon. If that reading is wrong the branch is
--- dead and costs nothing; if it is right, the alternative is a refused call
--- the player sees as an error from this addon.

-------------------------------------------------------
---------- Row tooltips
-------------------------------------------------------
-- Blizzard's own tooltip is REUSED rather than rebuilt. It is the whole listing
-- at a glance -- roles, every member, the comment, completed encounters -- and
-- reproducing it would be a few hundred lines that then drift from theirs.
--
-- What is added is the guard their own OnEnter lacks. Two of them:
--
--   1. THE LISTING MAY BE GONE. LFGBrowseSearchEntryTooltip_UpdateAndShow
--      indexes the search result with no nil check (Browse.lua:573-574), so
--      hovering a row whose listing was delisted between render and hover
--      throws inside Blizzard's file. This is the crash that was reported.
--
--   2. THE DATA MAY BE SECRET. That builder compares and formats fields that
--      are secret in chat-messaging lockdown -- `searchResultInfo.comment ~= ""`
--      and string.format on it (:679-680), LEVEL_ABBR .. leaderInfo.level
--      (:620), RAID_CLASS_COLORS[classFilename] (:616). All legal for
--      Blizzard's untainted code, none of it legal from ours.
--
-- One accessibility check answers for the whole structure, because
-- SecretInChatMessagingLockdown is a per-FUNCTION flag: it makes the entire
-- return secret, and the only per-field opt-out is NeverSecret, which
-- LfgSearchResultData grants to partyGUID alone. So testing one field settles
-- the rest.

-- Browse.xml:348-353 -- the inset the tooltip's own Comment uses
-- (LEFT x=11 / RIGHT x=-11), so this is Blizzard's number rather than a chosen
-- one, and it is what "inside the border" means for this frame.
local TOOLTIP_CONTENT_INSET = 11

--- Widen Blizzard's tooltip until nothing in a member row hangs over its edge.
---
--- A GUARD ON BLIZZARD'S BUILDER, which we inherit by displaying their
--- tooltip. LFGBrowseSearchEntryTooltip_UpdateAndShow sizes it as
---     self:SetWidth(math.max(maxContentWidth+22, LFGBROWSE_TOOLTIP_MIN_WIDTH))
--- (Browse.lua:834), and maxContentWidth counts the member rows -- the widest
--- name, then level, role icons and the crown (:562-570, :662-675) -- as well
--- as the activity and encounter strings (:742, :763, :788). So in the client
--- this normally finds nothing to widen. The member row still has no right
--- anchor to save it if that sum ever comes up short: Name is maxLines="1" on
--- a single TOPLEFT (Browse.xml:277), then Level at +4 and a 16px role icon at
--- +4, none of them clipped, so they would draw over the right border. Why it
--- was written, and the open question of keeping it:
--- .claude/rules/blizzard-source-citations.md.
---
--- MEASURED, NOT RE-DERIVED. Reproducing Blizzard's arithmetic from the XML --
--- inset, crown width, name, +4, level, +4, 16 per role -- would have to track
--- their constants. Asking the laid-out frames where they actually ended up is
--- shorter and cannot be wrong about font metrics, about those gap constants,
--- or about a later change to that XML.
---
--- ONE PASS IS ENOUGH, and that is a property of the anchoring rather than
--- luck: every row hangs off the tooltip's LEFT edge, so widening moves the
--- right border away from content that does not move with it.
---
--- Nothing leaks into Blizzard's own Group Finder: their builder recomputes
--- SetWidth from scratch on every hover (:834), so a tooltip we widened is
--- resized by them before they next show it.

-------------------------------------------------------
---------- The right-click menu
-------------------------------------------------------

--- Open Blizzard's own search-entry menu on one of our rows.
---
--- THEIR MENU, NOT ONE OF OURS. LFGBrowseMixin:CreateSearchEntryMenu reads only
--- searchEntry.resultID (Browse.lua:1002-1034), so a row of ours satisfies it --
--- and it brings the four actions with it: Send Message, Group Invite with its
--- eligibility rules (:1456-1472), Report Group and Report Advertisement
--- (:1495-1509), each with Blizzard's own localised label. Rebuilding that
--- would be a menu that has to be kept in step with theirs forever.
---
--- TWO THINGS THAT LOOK LIKE PROBLEMS AND ARE NOT, both checked:
---
---   * The menu opens at the CURSOR, not at the owner region --
---     InputUtil.AnchorRegionToCursor (Menu.lua:2602), and their comment at
---     :2581-2583 says so outright. The owner only decides when the menu
---     auto-closes.
---   * The owner they pass, LFGBrowseFrame.SearchEntryDropDown, is NIL -- the
---     name appears once in their whole addon, at that call site, and is never
---     assigned. MenuUtil substitutes GetAppropriateTopLevelParent()
---     (MenuUtil.lua:152-154). That matters: a real frame there would have been
---     on a window this one replaces and closes, and the menu polls
---     ownerRegion:IsVisible() and closes itself when that goes false
---     (Menu.lua:2504-2511).
---
--- THE COST, stated rather than hidden: the menu is built in OUR tainted stack,
--- and their SetEnabled checks only that leaderName is non-nil (:961), not that
--- it is READABLE. So in chat-messaging lockdown -- a dungeon, a raid, a
--- restricted map -- clicking Send Message (which string.formats the name,
--- ChatFrameUtil.lua:374) or Group Invite (SecretArguments =
--- "AllowedWhenUntainted") will error. Building our own menu was the only way
--- to disable those two, and it was not worth a parallel menu to do it. If it
--- proves annoying, a canaccessvalue guard here that refuses to open is the
--- smaller fix.
local function ShowRowMenu(row)
	-- CreateSearchEntryMenu is a method on LFGBrowseFrame, which lives in the
	-- LoadOnDemand Group Finder.
	--
	-- UNREACHABLE BY CONSTRUCTION, and kept anyway: a row can only exist if
	-- LFGBrowseSearchEntryTemplate did, and that template is in the same addon
	-- -- so by the time anything can be right-clicked, LFGBrowseFrame is there.
	-- Removing it fails no example, and that is said here rather than left for
	-- someone to discover. It stays because "every LFG frame access is behind
	-- an IsAddOnLoaded guard" is a rule worth being boring about, and because
	-- the day the list stops using their row template is the day this stops
	-- being dead.
	if not C_AddOns.IsAddOnLoaded("Blizzard_GroupFinder_VanillaStyle") then
		return
	end

	-- No nil-result guard here on purpose: theirs does it (Browse.lua:1004-1006),
	-- unlike their tooltip builder, which is why that one needed wrapping.
	LFGBrowseFrame:CreateSearchEntryMenu(row)
end

--- Take Blizzard's wiring off a row we borrowed the template from.
---
--- The template declares FIVE scripts (Mainline/Blizzard_LFGVanilla_Browse.xml)
--- and every runtime one reaches into LFGBrowseFrame or its globals:
---
---   OnLoad   registers LFG_LIST_SEARCH_RESULT_UPDATED   (Browse.lua:500-503)
---   OnEvent  -> LFGBrowseFrame:ValidateSelection()       (:505-513)
---   OnClick  -> LFGBrowseFrame.selectionBehavior         (:515-526)
---   OnEnter  -> LFGBrowseSearchEntryTooltip_UpdateAndShow(:528-535)
---   OnLeave  -> LFGBrowseSearchEntryTooltip:Hide()       (:537-540)
---
--- Missing one is not cosmetic. Leaving OnEnter attached shipped this, reported
--- from the client:
---
---   Browse.lua:544: attempt to index local 'searchResultInfo' (a nil value)
---     in function 'LFGBrowseSearchEntryTooltip_UpdateAndShow'
---     in function <Browse.lua:508>          <- LFGBrowseSearchEntry_OnEnter
---
--- That builder reads the search result WITHOUT a nil guard (:574), so hovering
--- a row whose listing has since been delisted crashes inside Blizzard's file,
--- blaming their code for our wiring.
---
--- OnLoad cannot be replaced -- it has already run by the time the frame
--- exists -- so its effect is undone instead: UnregisterAllEvents. Clearing
--- OnEvent alone would leave the row subscribed to an event it can do nothing
--- with. The redraw that pair did IS still wanted, so the panel does it
--- instead: see panel:UpdateResult.

		return

	-- Undoes OnLoad. Clearing OnEvent alone would leave the row subscribed to

	-- Theirs drives LFGBrowseFrame's selection (Browse.lua:522), which is their

	-- them is what detaches them; there is no need to nil them first.
	--
	-- The highlight half is not optional: Highlight sits in the HIGHLIGHT
	-- layer but is hidden="true" (Browse.xml:224), so the engine's hover
	-- display does not show it on its own. Drop the Show() below and the row
	-- never highlights.

-------------------------------------------------------
---------- The role filters
-------------------------------------------------------
-- TWO FILTERS, ONE PER KIND OF LISTING, and they ask OPPOSITE questions:
--
--   a PLAYER is kept when they OFFER ANY ticked role AND are of a ticked CLASS
--   a GROUP  is kept when it satisfies EVERY criterion the player ticked
--
-- Different questions, different combinators, different APIs -- a player's own
-- lfgRoles against a group's member tally. OR for players because the three
-- roles are one person's choices and any of them is a match; AND for groups
-- because each criterion narrows what the last one left, which is what lets
-- "no tank yet, and short of damage, and already has a healer" be asked at all.
--
-- Their defaults differ for the same reason: every player role on means "show
-- everyone", while every group box on would be a contradiction, so that
-- section starts empty.
--
-- The GROUP half comes first below, then the player half.
--
-- THE FIELD IS memberInfo.lfgRoles, from
-- C_LFGList.GetSearchResultPlayerInfo(resultID, 1). lfgRoles is an LFGRoles
-- structure -- {tank, healer, dps}, all bool -- and it is the roles the player
-- SIGNED UP for, which is exactly what Blizzard's own solo display reads
-- (Browse.lua:392 passes memberInfo.lfgRoles through as soloRoles, :931 reads
-- soloRoles.tank / .healer / .dps).
--
-- NOT assignedRole. It sits on the same structure and reads like the simpler
-- answer, but it is a secret-capable cstring, and `assignedRole == "TANK"` is a
-- COMPARISON -- one of the three operations that error on a secret. A bool
-- cannot have that problem, which is the general lesson for filtering this data
-- rather than a detail of this filter.
--
-- THE THREE ROLES ARE INDEPENDENT BOOLS, not one choice: a tank who also signed
-- up as dps is still a tank. So a listing matches if it offers ANY checked
-- role.
--
-- NO ROLE CHECKED MEANS NO CONSTRAINT, matching the activity dropdown in the
-- filter panel, where an empty selection means "all activities"
-- (core/filterpanel.lua RequestSearch). An empty filter never hides anything.
--
-- IT FAILS OPEN: a listing whose roles cannot be read is SHOWN. lfgRoles
-- carries no NeverSecret, so it is unreadable in a dungeon or raid, and hiding
-- what you could not verify would silently shrink the list there and read as
-- the server having stopped answering.

--- The five group criteria, in the order they are shown.
---
--- `counts` is the key into the {TANK, HEALER, DAMAGER} tally that
--- GetSearchResultMemberCounts returns -- note it is DAMAGER where the player
--- filter's LFGRoles field is `dps`.
---
--- `enough` is Blizzard's own idea of a full dungeon party:
--- LFGBROWSE_DUNGEON_NUM_TANKS_EXPECTED = 1, _HEALERS_EXPECTED = 1,
--- _DPS_EXPECTED = 3 (Browse.lua:27-29). Those are file-locals, restated here
--- rather than read.
---
--- `covered` is which way the test runs, and it is the whole difference
--- between the two rows:
---   false -- "<role> role available": the group is SHORT of that role
---   true  -- "Has <role>":            it already has enough
local GROUP_CRITERIA = {
	{ field = "tankAvailable",   counts = "TANK",    enough = 1, covered = false },
	{ field = "healerAvailable", counts = "HEALER",  enough = 1, covered = false },
	{ field = "damageAvailable", counts = "DAMAGER", enough = 3, covered = false },
	{ field = "hasTank",         counts = "TANK",    enough = 1, covered = true },
	{ field = "hasHealer",       counts = "HEALER",  enough = 1, covered = true },
}

--- Does this GROUP satisfy every criterion the player checked?
---
--- THEY AND TOGETHER. Each checked rule narrows what the one before it left,
--- and the first that fails drops the listing. That makes some combinations
--- deliberately empty -- "Tank role available" with "Has tank" cannot both
--- hold -- which is left possible rather than prevented: a control that
--- silently refused a click would be harder to explain than an empty list.
---
--- Nothing checked means no constraint, which is also the default. Unlike the
--- player filter, this section starts with every box OFF, because "all on"
--- here would be that same contradiction.
---
--- THE SOURCE IS GetSearchResultMemberCounts, the tally Blizzard's own
--- RoleCount display reads (Browse.lua:941-943). It is PRESENT in the client
--- dump but UNDOCUMENTED (0 documentation entries, 8 Blizzard call sites), so
--- whether it can return a secret is genuinely unknown. Guarded on that basis
--- and failing open -- per criterion, so one unreadable count does not decide
--- the rest.

--- Does this GROUP have no player of a class the class filter hides by?
---

--- and every class selected both mean no filter.
---
--- Each member's class, read the way Blizzard's camelot group tooltip reads
--- it: GetSearchResultPlayerInfo(resultID, i) for every member
--- (Blizzard_LFGVanilla_Browse.lua:640-645). GetSearchResultMemberCounts
--- carries class counts only in Blizzard's retail code (LFGList.lua:3211),
--- which camelot's never reads, so it is not relied on. Nothing is read
--- while the filter narrows nothing.
---
--- FAILS OPEN, member by member, by the author's decision: a member whose
--- data has not arrived, or whose class cannot be read, never hides a group;
--- only a member known to be of a hidden class does. Class data that arrives
--- after the search waits for the next one: a row update only redraws.
---
--- The class is read through Readable BEFORE it is used as a table key, which
--- errors on a secret in the client. The harness cannot falsify the guard (a
--- lookup by a mock secret is simply nil), as with AddPlayerKey's; in
--- lockdown numMembers is secret too, and such a listing never reaches here.

--- Build the tree: one Groups box, then one Players box.
---
--- TWO DIVERGENCES FROM BLIZZARD, both deliberate.
---
--- 1. Blizzard opens a new subtree whenever the category CHANGES as it walks
---    the results (Browse.lua:216-218), so an interleaved response produces
---    Groups / Players / Groups -- several boxes of the same kind. This
---    PARTITIONS first, so there is exactly one box per kind however the
---    results arrive, and collapsing Groups takes every group with it.
---
--- 2. Groups come first, regardless of the order the server sent.
---
--- YOUR OWN LISTING HEADS ITS BOX. That one is Blizzard's, and it is the FIRST
--- comparison their sorter makes -- ahead of matching activity, ahead of the
--- solo/group split:
---
---     if (hasSelf1 ~= hasSelf2) then
---         return hasSelf1; -- Always put self at the top.
---     end
--- Browse.lua:1356-1358
---
--- This panel partitions rather than sorts, so the rule lands as "first WITHIN
--- its box": your solo listing heads Players, your group heads Groups. It also
--- stays exempt from the filters, as it was before it was pinned -- a listing
--- of your own that the filters hide is a player wondering where their own post
--- went.
---
--- The third case is ours alone: when numMembers cannot be read the listing
--- belongs to neither bucket, so it goes at the root, unboxed. See the secret
--- discussion at the top of this file -- one flat list beats a wrong split.
--- THAT BEATS hasSelf, because pinning needs to know WHICH box to pin to, and
--- in chat-messaging lockdown there is no way to ask.
---
--- GUILDMATES AND FRIENDS COME NEXT, after your own listing: a solo player, or
--- a group's leader, the player knows (core/relations.lua). It orders and never
--- exempts -- unlike your own listing, a guildmate the filters exclude stays
--- excluded.
---
--- EACH PART IS NEWEST FIRST (NewestFirst, below), and so is the unboxed list,
--- so the order holds from one search to the next instead of following the
--- server's -- except the Players box's parts, which follow "Sort players by"
--- (PLAYER_ORDERS above; newest first unless the player chose otherwise).
---
--- THE RELATION IS DECIDED HERE, ONCE PER SEARCH, and stored on the node, so the
--- icon UpdateRow draws and the place this gives it are one answer and cannot
--- disagree. One lookup per search: it scans the Battle.net friends once, and
--- it is thrown away with the tree. Nothing listens for the roster or the

	--- results that arrive before the player's first Search (a search made in
	--- Blizzard's own Group Finder, or Blizzard re-searching when the player's
	--- listing changes) are filtered the way the boxes say.
	---
	--- CopyTable is DEEP unless asked otherwise (TableUtil.lua:218-228), so

	--- leave them shared with the filter panel's checkboxes, which is the one

	-- frames that must not know about each other exchange a signal; using it
	-- keeps these panels as decoupled as the result events already leave them.
	-- The filters ride along as this event's PAYLOAD rather than through a
	-- seam of their own. CallbackRegistry.lua:208-211 invokes func(owner, ...),
	-- so they arrive as the SECOND argument.
	--
	-- SNAPSHOT, NOT A LIVE READ, and that is the whole design: this panel never
	-- looks at a checkbox, so toggling one cannot change what is on screen
	-- until a search starts. "Applied on Search" becomes structural rather than
	-- a convention somebody has to remember.
