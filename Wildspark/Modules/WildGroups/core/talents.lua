-- core/talents.lua
--
-- THE PLAYER'S OWN TALENT POINTS, PER TREE, FOR THE ACTIVE SPEC. Read when the
-- window opens (core/window.lua, OnShow) and kept in LFGF.talentPoints, which
-- the Ask to Join whisper's %talents% turns into a word (LFGF.TalentRole, called
-- from LFGF.AskToJoinMessage in core/main.lua). See
-- .claude/rules/player-talents.md.
--
-- ON FOREVER THIS IS C_Traits, NOT THE CLASSIC TALENT API. GetTalentInfo(tab, i)
-- and GetNumTalentTabs are not in the client (GlobalAPI.lua). A class has one
-- trait tree split into three groups -- Arms / Fury / Protection -- each with
-- its own point count, and this file reads those counts exactly the way
-- Blizzard's camelot talent window does
-- (Blizzard_PlayerSpells/Camelot/ClassTalents/Blizzard_ClassTalentsFrame.lua):
--
--   1. the active spec group, 1 or 2 (:99-105);
--   2. that group's build: GetCombatConfigIDForSpecGroup (:160-172). NOT
--      C_ClassTalents.GetActiveConfigID -- the camelot window chooses by spec
--      group, and the sources do not say the two always agree here;
--   3. the build's tree: GetConfigInfo(...).treeIDs[1]
--      (Blizzard_SharedTalentFrame.lua:1315-1323);
--   4. the tree's groups, then every group's points in ONE call, each answer
--      matched to its group by traitNodeGroupID and read as
--      currencyInfos[1].spent (:73-96, :310-323).
--
-- NO EVENTS, BY DECISION. Nothing listens for a talent change: the numbers are
-- read on each open, and a change made while the window stays open shows on
-- the next one. Five engine calls and a handful of small tables per open.
--
-- NO SECRET GUARDS, BECAUSE NOTHING HERE IS SECRET. None of the five entries
-- carries SecretReturns, a SecretWhen* predicate or HasRestrictions
-- (SpecializationInfoDocumentation.lua:41-56, :90-104;
-- SharedTraitsDocumentation.lua:200-215, :280-310). Their only annotation is
-- SecretArguments = "AllowedWhenUntainted", which restricts what an addon may
-- PASS, and everything passed here is a plain number the client just answered.
-- spec/harness/traits_spec.lua fails if the documentation ever says otherwise.

--- THE WORD %talents% BECOMES, per class and tree, typed by the author. Keyed by
--- UnitClass's English class token (its SECOND return, classFilename, which
--- carries no secret predicate, UnitDocumentation.lua:925), and listed by the
--- tree's POSITION left to right -- the order ReadTalentPoints sorts by
--- orderIndex. Position rather than the raw orderIndex value, because the
--- sources do not say whether the game numbers the trees from 0 or from 1.
---
--- NEVER TRANSLATED, by the author's decision: these are the words a leader
--- reads in the whisper, whatever language the player's client is in. The
